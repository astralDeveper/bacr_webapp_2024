export const para = `The acronym HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning. It refers to the technology used for providing thermal
comfort and indoor air quality in buildings, ranging from
residential homes to large commercial complexes. An HVAC system is a
critical part of any building, ensuring a comfortable environment by
controlling temperature, humidity, and air quality. Whether you are
a homeowner looking to install a new system or a business seeking
reliable climate control, understanding the basics of HVAC is
essential.

            efficiently. This can involve cleaning air ducts, replacing filters,
            and inspecting components such as the HVAC coil cleaner to prevent
            system breakdowns. Timely maintenance can reduce energy consumption
            and extend the life of your equipment. Failing to maintain an HVAC
            system can lead to poor air quality, higher energy costs, and
            expensive repairs down the line.`;
