export const para = `The acronym HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning. It refers to the technology used for providing thermal
comfort and indoor air quality in buildings, ranging from
residential homes to large commercial complexes. An HVAC system is a
critical part of any building, ensuring a comfortable environment by
controlling temperature, humidity, and air quality. Whether you are
a homeowner looking to install a new system or a business seeking
reliable climate control, understanding the basics of HVAC is
essential.

components, discuss several types of systems, and explain the cost
factors associated with HVAC systems. Let us get started!`;

            interact:`;

export const para8 = `Most HVAC systems now include programmable thermostats or smart
            controls, allowing users to optimize energy efficiency and monitor usage remotely.`;

export const para9 = `Regular HVAC maintenance is necessary to keep the system functioning
            efficiently. This can involve cleaning air ducts, replacing filters,
            and inspecting components such as the HVAC coil cleaner to prevent
            system breakdowns. Timely maintenance can reduce energy consumption
            and extend the life of your equipment. Failing to maintain an HVAC
            system can lead to poor air quality, higher energy costs, and
            expensive repairs down the line.`;

export const para10 = `The cost of a new HVAC system varies depending on factors like the type 
            of system, the size of your building, and your location. For instance:`;

export const para11 = `Other variables include installation fees, whether you need ductwork repairs 
and the brand of the system. HVAC financing options are often available to help manage these costs.`;

export const para12 = `HVAC systems are critical for maintaining comfort and safety in both homes and businesses. 
By ensuring proper HVAC maintenance and choosing the right system, you can improve energy efficiency, lower costs, 
and create a healthier living or working environment. If you are considering upgrading your system, consult with a professional 
to determine the best solution for your needs.`;
